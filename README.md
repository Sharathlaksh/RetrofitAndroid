# Advantages of Android Retrofit
     1.Retrofit android is too easy to use.\n 
     2.It essentially lets you treat API calls as simple Java method calls,so you only define which URLs to hit and the types of the request/response parameters as Java classes.  
     3.The entire network call + JSON/XML parsing is completely handled by it (with help from Gson for JSON parsing), along with support for arbitrary formats with pluggable serialization/deserialization.
# Android Retrofit Speed
  Compared with Volley and AsyncTask,Retrofit provides faster response to the request.
# JSONPlaceholder
  JSONPlaceholder is a free online REST service that you can use whenever you need some dummy data.
